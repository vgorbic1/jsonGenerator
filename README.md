# jsonGenerator

## Processing JSON with JSR 353 streaming APIs.

This category of APIs supports the streaming model for both reading and writing the JSON content. 
Streaming APIs are grouped in the javax.json.stream package in the JSR specification. Streaming APIs read and write the 
content serially at runtime in accordance with client calls, which
makes them suitable for handling a large amount of data.

This project illustrates the use of streaming APIs for generating a JSON strings 
and JSON file of the employee objects (employee.json file).

*Use Java EE or SE with an imported ```javax.json``` library.*
